## Thirsty of technical topics? I have something good.

Book "Clean code" by Robert R. Martin. A book for people which already begun
their adventure with programming. We should remember automation is also a
programming task and we are obligated to write a clean code.  Book is a great
position to obtain good practices about code creation. It's a good starting
point in tech talk with programmer. Also when we will be asked for code review,
that book will be pretty helpful.  We would great opportunity to refer it in
comment - it allows build position within the team.  I assure you every
developer will appreciate a fact that their tester/QA knows guidelines learned
from Clean Code.

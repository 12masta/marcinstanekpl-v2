## Introduction

Often I am asked about educational materials, which helped me in my career.
I would like to share with those which have had greatest influence in my life.
They have different content, depending of the past of my career, so it is not
only about testing. It's worth to take a look even though you are not a tester
yet.  Today first material.

## Today lightly

technical background. Wide range of topics. Perfect case study on how to fill
technical gap by using other skills. Link:

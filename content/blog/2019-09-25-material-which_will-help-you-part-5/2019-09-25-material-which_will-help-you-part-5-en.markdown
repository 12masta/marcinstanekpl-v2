## Win a people

Book "How to Win Friends and Influence People" by Dale Carnegie. In my opinion
ever tester should read it. Absolutely amazing is fact that we know everything
what author wrote in this book, but we are not aware of it in our daily life.
Communication skills and interactions with people are invaluable in tester
profession.  You have to read it!

## Introduction

How do you like last book I've shared with you? Let me know what do you think about it.

## Podcast

Today I have for you another useful note. Podcast DevTalk by Maciej Aniserowicz.
A first podcast I've heard. I recommend to listen all sorts of podcasts - a vast
treasury of knowledge. Aniserowicz DevTalk is a very good place to grasp
the context about different technologies. Great place for testers, which in my
opinion should have such wide perspectives. "Try to learn something about
everything and everything about something." - it's a very accurate sentence
in the tester world.

## ISTQB

If it's obvious to you, forgive me. Today I would like to share with materials
which allowed me find my first job.

Syllabus ISTQB. You don't have to pass an exam on beginning of your career.
It's enough to read content of syllabus. You can commend your syllabus
experience in CV, however first I recommend read it at least twice and start
public questions from exam, as I did it.
